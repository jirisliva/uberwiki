Paragraph 3.3
-------------

> Names of fields being used as *constants* should be all upper-case, with underscores separating words. 
> The following are considered to be constants:
>
> 1. All static final primitive types (Remember that all interface fields are inherently static final).
> 2. All static final object reference types that are never followed by "." (dot).
> 3. All static final arrays that are never followed by "[" (dot).
> Examples:

> MIN_VALUE, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, OPTIONS_FILE_NAME
